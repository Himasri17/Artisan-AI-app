## üí° The Problem

India's local artisans are custodians of a rich cultural heritage. However, they often face significant hurdles in the modern digital economy. A lack of digital marketing skills, limited resources, and the difficulty of telling their story effectively online prevent them from reaching a wider audience, limiting their profitability and threatening the sustainability of their craft.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

**Artisan's AI Marketing Assistant** acts as a personal marketing expert for every artisan. By leveraging Google's Gemini Pro AI, our application analyzes a photo of their craft and instantly generates a complete digital marketing kit, including:

* **Product Titles:** Catchy and optimized for online searches.
* **Product Descriptions:** Warm, story-driven text that highlights the product's heritage and value.
* **Social Media Posts:** Engaging captions with relevant hashtags, ready for platforms like Instagram.

This tool automates the difficult task of content creation, allowing artisans to focus on what they do best: creating beautiful art.
